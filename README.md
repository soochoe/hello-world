# hello-world

Hi Everyone,

Welcome to my Data Science Portfolio.
I am a recent graduate of a dual degree program in Mechatronics Systems Engineering and Business at Western University. 
I am currently transitioning into Data Science and taking on new side projects. I am interested in merging my interests in fashion and technology and I am looking for opportunities in this exciting space.

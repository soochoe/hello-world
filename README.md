# hello-world

Hi Everyone,

I am currently in my last year of a dual degree program in Mechatronics Systems Engineering and Business at Western University. I am in pursuit of transitioning into Data Analytics/Science. In the next 6 months, I will be focusing on the following three goals:
1) Learn Python & Sparks
2) Learn SQL
3) Complete a Kaggle competition 

In the next three weeks, I will be learning Python by taking the Udemy course on Data Science and Machine Learning with Python - Hands on Learning. 

This is my progress :)
